<li>For a number of years, McKinsey have been conducting global research into the value of gender diversity in the workplace. McKinsey’s 2012 report <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/global-locations/europe-and-middleeast/france/en/latest-thinking/women-matter" target="_blank">‘Women Matter’</a> benchmarked the diversity programmes of 235 European companies indicating the best performing companies had a ‘critical mass of initiatives’ in place.  Within this list of initiatives were programmes ‘to smooth transition before, during and after maternity leave’
