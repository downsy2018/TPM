                <p>The reasons for cancellation charging are:</p>

                <p>1.   When a session is booked, Purple Shark turns down other work for that  timeframe. The coaching and development process is a mutual act and a mutual contract.</p>
                <p>2.   It is there, as part of the coaching and development purpose to ‘hold up the mirror’ on the behaviour of the client or culture of the organisation.</p>
                <p>3.   It is part of the learning process, because when working on deep, personal and change issues, the tendency of most people is to avoid it. Cancelling or postponing is part of the defence (albeit unconscious most of the time) and the learning process of the coaching / development is compromised unless the contract on timing is maintained.</p>
                <p>4.   Missed sessions mean a loss in momentum and traction on meeting goals.</p>

                <p>However, in cases of urgent health or emergencies, the session can be moved to a telephone session at no additional charge or loss of session.</p>

                <p>In the event of illness, Purple Shark Ltd. will reschedule the coaching / development session as soon as possible after the cancelled date. No fees will be payable to Purple Shark Ltd. for the cancelled work. The rescheduled work will be payable at 80% of agreed fees.</p>

                <p>In the event of cancellation by Purple Shark Ltd. due to illness or any other reason beyond its control, Purple Shark Ltd. will not be responsible for any consequential losses by the client for cancelled accommodation or any other liability.</p>

                <p>Purple Shark Ltd. does not accept liability for circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including Acts of God, labour disputes or unavoidable transport delays. Purple Shark Ltd. guarantees to make all reasonable efforts to deliver the services as required.</p>

                <p>In addition, liability as regards any breach of contract, misrepresentation or negligence on Purple Shark Ltd’s part is limited to the fee payable to Purple Shark Ltd. in respect of the relevant project. Purple Shark Ltd. does not in any event accept liability for consequential or indirect loss or loss of profit.</p>

                <p>Any knowledge gained by Purple Shark Ltd. about the client’s business remains strictly confidential, unless the client specifies otherwise.</p>
