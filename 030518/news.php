                <p>Millicent Fawcett campaigned for six decades for women to have the right to vote. Importantly she recognised the power of starting a movement - men and women coming together to make a difference.  We’re featured in this month’s Fawcett Society’s magazine – super proud to be centenary fundraisers!</p>

                <h2>PTS Live</h2>
                <p>On 12th May Nicki was invited to co-host the first Festival of Motherhood and Work - Pregnant Then Screwed LIVE at Manchester Science Park.  The day was absolutely amazing and testament to Founder Joeli Brearley’s ability to take an idea and always think BIG.  She offers no small ambition – to end maternity discrimination in the workplace for good.  So many amazing women at this sell out event; incredible speakers, Q&A sessions, book signings, taster workshops, legal advice, 1-1 coaching, exhibitors etc.  What a day!</p>

            <h2>Journeys to Working Parenthood</h2>
            <p>We have many amazing conversations with clients, managers, mentors and mentees and in our work have amassed a veritable smorgasbord of stories and insights.  In conjunction with the creative genius that is Philippa Woods, we’ve developed ‘Working Parents’ Wisdom’ (WPW) a series of simple sketchnotes sharing some of the many tips, ideas and insights from working parents, about things they’ve learned, things they’d do differently and advice they’d give to their former self.</p>

                    <h2>Ending Work</h2>
                    <p>Here we share some tips and ideas from working parents about the tricky business of disconnecting and ending work to go on maternity / parental leave.  What do people say about this stage of the journey? Typically the focus is all on work, we write copious handover notes (which rarely get used or accessed), we work longer and harder in an effort to prove the rule that pregnancy is not an illness and won’t change anything. But there comes a point where the personal agenda inevitably collides with the work agenda. We become the elephant in the room – quite literally! There is a dawning realisation that there’ll be no going back. This baby is going to arrive. We might have an expected due date in the diary, but for most of us (planned ‘c’ sections aside) this biological package comes with no guaranteed delivery date.</p>
                    <p>So how to end work well?</p>

                    <h2>Transitioning Away from Work</h2>
                    <p>Here’s our next sketchnote on the Journey to Working Parenthood; packed with practical tips and ideas from working parents who've been there, got the t shirt and know something about the importance of smoothing the transition away from work ahead of maternity/parental leave.</p>
                    <p>You might be working with someone right now who might find this helpful to articulate just what’s needed at this point.  It’s useful conversation starter with a manager and or a mentor. What would you add if this was a sketchnote of the things you needed at this point on the journey?</p>

                    <h2>Early Parental Leave</h2>
                    <p>This sketchnote is all about the heady days of early parental leave; that complete and unexpected disconnection from work and immersion into uncharted territory.   A life twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, where there is (usually) no immediate prospect of a day off or holiday.  A world away from work – from what was known, planned, organised, rewarded. A new job with assumptions of innate knowledge, uncompromising demands for resilience, new measures of success, new skills, new allies, new friendships, new learning every day and at the heart, the excitement and joy of a new baby.</p>
                    <p>Becoming a parent for the first time can be a lonely place.  These are highly individual journeys, but the themes repeat and we can take comfort from knowing that we aren't the first to have found this a challenging transition. </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Take it as an opportunity to re-connect with someone who may be on leave right now and ask how they’re doing.</p>

                    <h2>Working Parents’ Wisdom – The KIT Box</h2>
                    <p>When asked ‘Do you want to keep in touch on maternity leave?’ the majority of us say ‘absolutely’ though we’re not always entirely sure what that looks like, so things can often be left open ended and rather vague. Of course when a baby arrives, the reality is we get pretty busy and for a while, work drops off the radar. But there comes a point where the return to work is on the horizon and we realise we’re out of touch. During parental leave, many prospective returners tell us they find themselves feeling like outsiders; forgotten about, disconnected, with communication channels down.</p>
                    <p>Our latest sketchnote is a call to encourage employees and managers to keep communications open and offers suggestions of things to share during leave as well as agreeing the method of communication (e.g. phone, email, text, social media).</p>
                    <p>In the UK employees can also use up to 10 Keeping in Touch days during maternity / adoption / additional paternity leave. Useful for smoothing the transition back to work, KIT days are typically work focused e.g. team meetings, training days, conferences. NB Both employer and employee need to agree to them and confirm how and when they'll be paid.</p>
