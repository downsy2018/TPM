                The Equalities and Human Rights Commission estimates maternity discrimination results in 54000 women losing their job each year in the UK.  This led to them setting up <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/pregnancy-and-maternity-workplace/working-forward" target="_blank">Working Forward</a> a collaboration of employers and industry bodies aiming to make UK workplaces the best they can be for pregnant women and new parents. Their research (published February 2018) accuses British employers of ‘living in the dark ages’ with ‘worrying attitudes’ and ‘unlawful behaviour when it comes to recruiting women’ – in particular Small Medium Enterprises.

                I had the opportunity to hear Professor Susan Vinnicombe from Cranfield School of Management speak on International Women’s Day a number of years ago when I was working for Asda Walmart.
